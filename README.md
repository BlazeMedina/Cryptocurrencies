# Crypto_Clustering

## Project Overview


Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data I will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. I've decided to use unsupervised learning since there is no known output. I will use data visualizations to share my findings with the board.

This new assignment consisted of four technical analysis parts:
-   Part 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
-   Part 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
-   Part 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
-   Part 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Resources
* Python (Pandas, hvPlot, Plotly, Skikit learn)
 * Unsupervised Machine Leaning CSV File (data)
## Results
Given the original data, I cleaned it by removing null rows and keeping only cryptocurrency that is currently trading.  I also removed rows where it's currency was not being mined.

I then reduced the dimensions to three principal components.

Using an Elbow Curve, I identified that the K-Means should have 4 clusters.

I then created a 3D-Scatter Graph with the data.

I determined that there were 532 tradable cryptocurrencies and placed them on a table.

I scaled the tradable cryptocurrencies data.  I lastly created a scatter plot using the scaled tradable cryptocurrency data.
